Hello I'm Mostafa Alsaddek

In this project, I use Eclipse, Maven, Java, Cucumber, and JUnit runner.
I develop this framework in Page Object Model

I make 1 scenario: Search for System Egypt on Google

I implement the needed TC
1. Open [https://www.google.com/]
2. Type and search for “SYSTEMS EGYPT”
3. Scroll down and go to the next page
4. Count the number of results displayed on the second page (exclude maps, videos, or images)
5. Scroll down and go to the next page
6. Validate if the number of results on page 2 is equal to page 3
7. Close the browser window

You can get the feature file in (src/test/java/features/Search.feature)
	
I make an implicite wait with max 10 seconds in the SD file in the Setup method to avoid any delay in the search scenario.

I create an Excel configuration file that contains the website URL and the Driver type for Chrome, firefox, or Edge. End user can set it in the excel file to select the driver based on Driver value (Chrome - FireFox - Edge).

As this is a POM, I create a class for each page of the application
each class contain the page elements and the action on these elements, so I can use them in the test steps by the SD file.
You can find them in pages package (src/main/java/pages) 

As this is a Cucumber I create the step definition file in sdFiles package (src/main/java/sdFiles) that contains the actions for each command in the feature file.

I use a local report after each run in HTML, you can find the test report in (target\cucumber-reports\cucumber-html-report.html)
========================================================================

To run this application you need to import the project to Eclipse then Go to the Runner file (src/test/java/runner/Runner.java) then run as "JUnit Test"
-------------------------------
No need to attach "chromedriver" / "geckodriver" to this project as I use Driver manager dependency
-------------------------------
Note: I use Windows and Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Version: 2024-09 (4.33.0)
